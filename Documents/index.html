Among them includes the public lynching of Ahmaud Arbery in Glynn County, Georgia. The death of George Floyd by police brutality Minneapolis, Minnesota, regardless of the optics of whether or not this was racially motivated or simply a case of police's abuse of power, was the last straw led to public outcry the likes of which the US has not seen since the abolishment of slavery. All across the world, BLM protests sprung up both in solidarity of systematic racism in the US, and in many cases, to protest the racial injustices that exist within their own countries.</td>

Just a day later, another shooting incident occurred alarmingly close to home, the details of which have yet to surface. Nonetheless, this is unprecendented.</td>
